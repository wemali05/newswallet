# News Wallet

## Client Problem Statement 

I read a lot of news articles and many are the times I find very good articles that are worth saving for future reference. As it stands, there is no better way to do this other than bookmark the link to the site on my browser or save it on Opera Mini, options that I donâ€™t find helpful for my needs.
